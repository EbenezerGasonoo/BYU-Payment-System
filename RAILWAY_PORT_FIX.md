# 🔧 Railway PORT Configuration Issue

## Problem Identified

Your backend logs show:
```
🚀 Server is running on port 3000
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

But Railway returns 502. This means:
- ✅ App is running correctly
- ❌ Railway can't connect to it

## Root Cause

Railway assigns a dynamic PORT (not always 3000) and expects your app to use it.

## ✅ SOLUTION - Set PORT in Railway

**Go to Railway and add/verify environment variable:**

1. **Railway Dashboard:** https://railway.app/project/f4c56b76-70fd-41b2-a00b-b1f3b8b2d83d

2. **Click on your backend service**

3. **Go to "Variables" tab**

4. **Check if `PORT` exists:**
   - If Railway hasn't auto-set it, the app defaults to 3000
   - Railway might be trying to connect on a different port

5. **Check "Settings" → "Networking":**
   - Look for what port Railway is exposing
   - It should match what your app is using

## 🎯 Alternative: Railway Might Need Time

Railway sometimes takes a few minutes after the first successful MongoDB connection to stabilize routing.

**Try this:**

1. Wait another 2-3 minutes
2. Test again: `curl https://byupay.up.railway.app/api/health`

## 🔧 Check Railway Health Check

In Railway:
1. Go to Settings
2. Check "Health Check Path" 
3. Should be: `/api/health`
4. Check "Health Check Timeout"
5. Should be at least 60 seconds

## 📋 Current server.js Configuration

Your code:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

This SHOULD work, but Railway might need the health check to pass first.

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### Option 1: Wait and Test
```bash
# Wait 2 minutes
curl https://byupay.up.railway.app/api/health
```

### Option 2: Force Redeploy
1. Railway → Settings → Scroll down
2. Click "Redeploy" 
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Test again

### Option 3: Check Railway Public Domain
1. Railway → Settings → "Networking"
2. Verify "Generate Domain" is enabled
3. Check if domain is: `byupay.up.railway.app`

## 🐛 Debug: Check What Port Railway Expects

In Railway Variables tab, look for:
- `PORT` - Should be set by Railway automatically
- If not there, Railway might be using default

The logs show app listening on 3000, which is correct if Railway didn't provide a PORT.
