# ✅ Hubtel Integration Complete!

## 🎉 What I've Done

I've successfully integrated your Hubtel API credentials into the BYU Payment System!

### ✅ Backend Integration:

1. **Created Hubtel Service** (`backend/utils/hubtelService.js`):
   - `initiatePayment()` - Starts payment process
   - `checkPaymentStatus()` - Verifies payment status
   - Uses your credentials: API ID `GR69OD8` and API Key

2. **Added API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/student/initiate-hubtel-payment` - Initiates Hubtel payment
   - `POST /api/student/hubtel-callback` - Receives payment status from Hubtel

3. **Updated Database Model**:
   - Added `hubtelCheckoutId` field to track Hubtel transactions

4. **Configured Credentials**:
   - API ID: `GR69OD8`
   - API Key: `04abf4cbb3c041839c1c3af89c3ebea2`
   - API URL: `https://payproxyapi.hubtel.com/items/initiate`

### ✅ Frontend Integration:

1. **Updated HubtelPayment Component**:
   - Calls backend to initiate Hubtel payment
   - Redirects to Hubtel checkout page
   - Handles payment success/failure

2. **Payment Flow**:
   - Student enters phone number
   - Clicks "Proceed to Pay"
   - Redirected to Hubtel checkout page
   - Completes payment on Hubtel
   - Hubtel sends callback to backend
   - Backend auto-verifies payment
   - Student redirected back to dashboard

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### For **Mobile Money (Hubtel)** Payment Method:

1. **Student Initiates Payment:**
   ```
   Enter amount: $100
   See calculation: GHS 1,627.50
   Select: Mobile Money (Hubtel)
   Enter phone: 0241234567
   Click: Proceed to Pay
   ```

2. **System Calls Hubtel API:**
   ```javascript
   POST https://payproxyapi.hubtel.com/items/initiate
   Authorization: Basic Base64(GR69OD8:04abf4cbb3c041839c1c3af89c3ebea2)
   Body: {
     totalAmount: 1627.50,
     description: "BYU Payment - Student Name",
     callbackUrl: "https://byupay.up.railway.app/api/student/hubtel-callback",
     returnUrl: "https://byupay.vercel.app/dashboard",
     clientReference: "BYU-1698765432-E5F6G7H8"
   }
   ```

3. **Hubtel Returns Checkout URL:**
   ```javascript
   Response: {
     checkoutId: "abc123",
     checkoutUrl: "https://checkout.hubtel.com/abc123",
     status: "pending"
   }
   ```

4. **Student Redirected to Hubtel:**
   - Opens Hubtel checkout page
   - Enters payment details
   - Completes payment

5. **Hubtel Sends Callback:**
   ```javascript
   POST https://byupay.up.railway.app/api/student/hubtel-callback
   Body: {
     ResponseCode: "0000", // success
     Data: {
       ClientReference: "BYU-1698765432-E5F6G7H8",
       Amount: 1627.50,
       Status: "Paid"
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Backend Auto-Verifies:**
   - Finds card request by paymentReference
   - Updates paymentStatus to "paid"
   - Notifies admin
   - Student redirected to dashboard

### For **MTN Mobile Money Direct** Payment Method:

1. Student manually sends money to `0241234567`
2. Includes payment reference
3. Admin manually verifies in MTN account
4. Admin clicks "Verify Payment" in dashboard

## ⚙️ Configuration Needed in Railway

To make the Hubtel webhook work, you need to set environment variables in Railway:

### Railway Environment Variables:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/your-project
2. Select your backend service
3. Click **"Variables"** tab
4. Add these:

```env
HUBTEL_API_KEY=04abf4cbb3c041839c1c3af89c3ebea2
HUBTEL_API_ID=GR69OD8
HUBTEL_API_URL=https://payproxyapi.hubtel.com/items/initiate
```

5. Click **"Deploy"**

---

## 🔗 Configure Hubtel Webhook

To receive automatic payment notifications:

### Option 1: Hubtel Dashboard

1. Login to Hubtel Dashboard: https://app.hubtel.com
2. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks** or **Callback URLs**
3. Add callback URL:
   ```
   https://byupay.up.railway.app/api/student/hubtel-callback
   ```
4. Select events:
   - ✅ Payment Successful
   - ✅ Payment Failed
5. Save

### Option 2: API Configuration

If Hubtel uses API-level callback configuration, it's already set in the code:
```javascript
callbackUrl: `https://byupay.up.railway.app/api/student/hubtel-callback`
```
