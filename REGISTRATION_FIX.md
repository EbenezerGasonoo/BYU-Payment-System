# Registration Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified
The registration was failing due to an **API configuration issue** in the frontend.

### Root Causes:
1. **Frontend server was not running** - Users need both backend AND frontend servers running
2. **API URL misconfiguration** - Frontend was trying to connect to `http://localhost:3000/api` directly, causing CORS issues
3. **Vite proxy not being used** - The Vite dev server has a proxy configured, but the API wasn't using it

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed API Configuration
**File: `frontend/src/api/api.js`**
- Changed: `const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api';`
- To: `const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || '/api';`

This now uses the Vite proxy, which forwards `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3000` automatically, avoiding CORS issues.

### 2. Added Environment Variable Documentation
**File: `frontend/.env.example`**
- Created example file documenting the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
- Shows how to override if needed

## How to Start the Application

### Step 1: Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
The backend will run on **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 2: Start Frontend Server (in a NEW terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on **http://localhost:5173**

### Step 3: Access the Application
Open your browser to: **http://localhost:5173**

## Testing the Registration

1. Navigate to the **Student Registration** page
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Your full name
   - **BYU Student ID**: Exactly 9 digits (e.g., `123456789`)
   - **Email**: Must end with `@byupathway.edu`
   - **Phone**: Your phone number
3. Click **Register**
4. You should see a success message! ✅

## Verification

I tested the backend registration endpoint directly and it works perfectly:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Student registered successfully",
  "data": {
    "name": "Test Student",
    "byuId": "123456789",
    "email": "test@byupathway.edu",
    "phone": "+233 24 123 4567"
  }
}
```

## Quick Start Scripts

You can use the existing batch files:
- **Backend**: Double-click `start-backend.bat`
- **Frontend**: Double-click `start-frontend.bat`

Make sure to run BOTH servers!

## Common Issues

### "Registration failed" error
- ✅ **Fixed**: API URL now uses proxy correctly
- Make sure both servers are running
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### CORS errors
- ✅ **Fixed**: Using Vite proxy eliminates CORS issues in development
- Backend has CORS enabled for production deployments

### "Student already exists" error
- This is expected if you're trying to register with the same BYU ID or email
- Use a different BYU ID or email address

## For Production Deployment

When deploying to production (Vercel, Railway, etc.), you'll need to:
1. Set the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable to your backend URL
2. Example: `VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api`

The frontend `.env.example` file documents this configuration.
