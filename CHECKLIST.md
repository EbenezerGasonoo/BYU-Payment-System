## üîß Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start

**Issue**: MongoDB connection error
- [ ] Check MongoDB is installed
- [ ] Check MongoDB service is running
- [ ] Try: `mongosh` in terminal
- [ ] See: [MONGODB_SETUP.md](MONGODB_SETUP.md)

**Issue**: Port 3000 already in use
- [ ] Change PORT in backend/.env
- [ ] Or stop other application using port 3000

**Issue**: Module not found
- [ ] Run `npm install` in backend folder
- [ ] Check package.json exists

### Frontend Won't Start

**Issue**: Port 5173 already in use
- [ ] Change port in frontend/vite.config.js
- [ ] Or stop other application using port 5173

**Issue**: Module not found
- [ ] Run `npm install` in frontend folder
- [ ] Check package.json exists

### API Connection Failed

**Issue**: Frontend can't connect to backend
- [ ] Verify backend is running on port 3000
- [ ] Check http://localhost:3000 in browser
- [ ] Check browser console for CORS errors
- [ ] Verify vite.config.js proxy settings

### Email Not Working

**Issue**: Emails not being sent
- [ ] Verify EMAIL_USER in .env
- [ ] Verify EMAIL_PASSWORD is App Password (not regular password)
- [ ] Check 2FA is enabled on Gmail
- [ ] Check backend console for email errors
- Note: System works without email, just no notifications

## üìä System Health Check

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check backend API
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check frontend
curl http://localhost:5173

# Test student registration (requires backend running)
cd backend
node test-api.js
```

- [ ] Backend API responds
- [ ] Frontend loads
- [ ] Test script passes

## üìù Common Commands

```bash
# Start backend
cd "I:\Projects\BYU Payment System\backend"
npm run dev

# Start frontend
cd "I:\Projects\BYU Payment System\frontend"
npm run dev

# Check MongoDB
mongosh

# View database
mongosh
use byu_virtual
db.students.find().pretty()
db.cardrequests.find().pretty()

# Run API tests
cd backend
node test-api.js
```
