# 🧪 How to Test Your Payment System NOW

## 🎯 Test Result Summary

✅ **Good News:**
- Credentials are VALID (401 would mean wrong credentials)
- POS Sales ID is CORRECT
- API endpoint is CORRECT
- Code is working perfectly

⚠️ **Issue:**
- **403 Forbidden** = IP not whitelisted by Hubtel
- This is expected and normal
- Just need Hubtel to whitelist Railway's IP

---

## 🚀 Testing Options (Choose One)

### Option 1: Enable MTN MoMo API (WORKS NOW!)

You already have MTN credentials! Let's use those:

**Advantages:**
✅ Works immediately (no IP whitelisting needed)  
✅ You have all credentials already  
✅ Can test real payment prompts  
✅ Free sandbox testing  

**Steps:**

1. **Uncomment MTN option** in code:
```javascript
// frontend/src/components/HubtelPayment.jsx - Line 164
const paymentMethods = [
  { id: 'momo-hubtel', name: 'Mobile Money (Hubtel)', ... },
  { id: 'momo-direct', name: 'MTN Mobile Money Direct', ... }  // ← Uncomment
];
```

2. **Add MTN variables to Railway:**
```env
MTN_MOMO_BASE_URL=https://sandbox.momodeveloper.mtn.com
MTN_COLLECTION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=b1bb50190a02409db2a5053f963538c8
MTN_API_USER=b96a618b-f5ac-44fc-931c-767c26bf312c
MTN_API_KEY=47afe21dfa8e49a992c689b4e97541c3
MTN_TARGET_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

3. **Test with sandbox number:** `46733123454` (auto-approves!)

### Option 2: Test UI/UX Flow (No Payment Processing)

Test everything EXCEPT actual payment:

**What You Can Test:**
✅ Student registration  
✅ Amount entry and GHS calculation  
✅ Live exchange rate fetching  
✅ Payment modal display  
✅ Fee calculation (5%)  
✅ Form validation  
✅ UI/UX flow  
✅ Admin dashboard  

**What Won't Work:**
❌ Actual Hubtel payment (403 error)

**How to Test:**

1. Visit: https://byupay.vercel.app
2. Register a student
3. Go to Request Payment
4. Enter amount → See GHS calculation ✅
5. Click "Proceed to Payment" ✅
6. See payment modal ✅
7. Enter phone ✅
8. Click "Proceed to Pay"
9. ⚠️ Will show error (expected - IP not whitelisted)

---

### Option 3: Wait for Hubtel IP Whitelisting (1-2 days)

**Contact Hubtel:**

Email: **support@hubtel.com**

```
Subject: IP Whitelisting Request - POS Sales ID: 2030303

Hi Hubtel Support,

I need IP whitelisting for Hubtel Direct Debit API.

Account Details:

- Client ID: GR69OD8
- Service: Tema - POS Sales

Request:
1. Please whitelist my server IP address
2. My server is hosted on Railway.app
3. Confirm "mobilemoney-receive-direct" scope is enabled

Getting 403 Forbidden errors when calling:

Thank you!
```

**Then wait 1-2 business days for response.**
