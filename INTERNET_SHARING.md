# 🌍 Share Your App on the Internet

## ✅ Quick Internet Exposure with Localtunnel

Your app is now being exposed to the internet using **localtunnel**!

### 🔗 Public URLs

**Frontend (React App):**
```
https://byu-pathway-ghana.loca.lt
```
Or it may use a random subdomain if the name is taken.

**Backend (API):**
You'll need to expose this too for full functionality.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

**Localtunnel** creates a secure tunnel from your local server to a public URL.

Current Setup:
- ✅ Frontend running on: `localhost:5175`
- ✅ Tunnel exposing it to: `https://byu-pathway-ghana.loca.lt` (or similar)

---

## 📱 Share With Anyone

Send this URL to anyone:
```
https://byu-pathway-ghana.loca.lt
```

They can:
- ✅ Register as students
- ✅ Request virtual cards
- ✅ View dashboards
- ✅ Install as PWA on their phone
- ✅ Access from anywhere in the world!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security:
- 🔒 This is for **testing/demo only**
- 🔒 Don't use with real sensitive data
- 🔒 The URL is temporary (as long as tunnel is running)
- 🔒 Free tier has limitations

### Limitations:
- Tunnel closes when you stop the terminal
- URL changes if you restart
- May have bandwidth limits
- First visit may show a warning page (click "Continue")

## 🔧 Alternative Options

### Option 1: Ngrok (More Reliable)

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose frontend
ngrok http 5175

# Expose backend (in another terminal)
ngrok http 3000
```

You'll get URLs like:
- `https://abc123.ngrok.io` (frontend)
- `https://xyz789.ngrok.io` (backend)

### Option 2: Cloudflare Tunnel (Free, Persistent)

```bash
# Install cloudflared
# Download from: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/

# Expose
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5175
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Cloud (Production)

**Frontend:**
- Vercel: `vercel deploy` (automatic from GitHub)
- Netlify: Drag & drop `dist` folder
- GitHub Pages

**Backend:**
- Heroku: `git push heroku main`
- Railway: Connect GitHub repo
- Render: Automatic deployment

**Database:**
- MongoDB Atlas (cloud)

## 🎯 To Expose Backend Too

Open another terminal:

```bash
lt --port 3000 --subdomain byu-pathway-api
```

Then update frontend to use the backend tunnel URL.

---

## 🛑 Stop Sharing

To stop the tunnel:
1. Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal running `lt`
2. Your app is no longer public

---

## 📊 Check Your Tunnel

The terminal should show:
```
your url is: https://byu-pathway-ghana.loca.lt
```

Visit that URL and you're live! 🚀

I'll create scripts to make this easier...

**Note:** Keep the terminal running as long as you want to share!
