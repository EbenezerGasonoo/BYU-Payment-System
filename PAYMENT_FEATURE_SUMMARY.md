# 💳 Payment Feature Implementation - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

I've successfully integrated **Hubtel payment gateway** into your BYU Payment System. Students now **must pay first** before their card request is submitted to admin.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Old Flow (Before):
1. Student enters amount
2. Request submitted to admin
3. ❌ No payment tracking

### New Flow (After):
1. Student enters amount in USD
2. System calculates GHS amount (with live exchange rate)
3. System adds 5% chargeback fee
4. Student sees total to pay
5. **Student chooses payment method** (MoMo, Cash, or Bank)
6. **Student completes payment**
7. System verifies payment
8. ✅ Request submitted to admin (PAID status)
