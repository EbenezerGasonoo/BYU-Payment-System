# 🔍 Railway Configuration Check

## Potential Issue: PORT Environment Variable

Railway automatically assigns a `PORT` environment variable, but the app might not be using it correctly.

## ✅ Quick Fix - Check These in Railway:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   https://railway.app/project/f4c56b76-70fd-41b2-a00b-b1f3b8b2d83d

2. **Click on your backend service**

3. **Go to "Variables" tab**

4. **Check if `PORT` is set:**
   - Railway should auto-set this
   - If not set, DON'T manually add it (Railway does this automatically)

5. **Go to "Settings" tab**

6. **Check "Start Command":**
   - Should be: `npm start` or `node server.js`
   - Make sure it's correct

7. **Check "Healthcheck Path":**
   - Should be: `/api/health`
   - Make sure this is set in your `railway.json`

## 🔧 Alternative: Check Deployment Logs

1. In Railway, click "Deployments" tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Look for:
   - ✅ Build completed successfully?
   - ✅ "MongoDB connected successfully" message?
   - ✅ "Server is running on port XXXX" message?
   - ❌ Any error messages?

## 🐛 Common Railway Issues:

### Issue 1: App crashes after MongoDB connection
**Symptom:** Logs show MongoDB connected, then app restarts  
**Solution:** App might be exiting due to another error

### Issue 2: Wrong PORT
**Symptom:** App runs but Railway can't connect  
**Solution:** Must use `process.env.PORT` (already in code)

### Issue 3: Health check failing
**Symptom:** 502 even though app is running  
**Solution:** Health check path must match `/api/health`

### Issue 4: Build succeeded but deploy failed
**Symptom:** Green checkmark on build, red X on deploy  
**Solution:** Check runtime logs for errors

## 📋 What to Check Right Now:

1. **Go to Railway → Your Service → Deployments**
2. **Check the latest deployment status:**
   - Is it green (deployed)?
   - Or red (failed)?
   - Or yellow (deploying)?

3. **Click on the deployment and check logs:**
   - Do you see "MongoDB connected successfully"?
   - Do you see "Server is running on port 3000"?
   - Any errors after that?

4. **Share the latest 20 lines of logs with me!**

## 🎯 Expected Log Output:

```
✅ Card expiry cron job started
🚀 Server is running on port 3000
📡 API URL: http://localhost:3000
💬 Live Chat: Enabled
📧 Email notifications: Enabled
🔐 Admin key: Set
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

If you see all of these, the app is running correctly and the issue is with Railway's networking configuration.

## 🔧 Nuclear Option: Redeploy

If nothing works:

1. Go to Railway → Your Service → Settings
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click "Redeploy" button
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Test again
