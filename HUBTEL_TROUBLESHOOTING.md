# üîß Hubtel "Failed to Initiate Payment" - Troubleshooting Guide

## üéØ Issue: "Failed to initiate payment"

Good news: The route exists! (Progress from "Route not found")  
Issue: Hubtel API call is failing

---

## üîç Common Causes

### 1. **IP Whitelisting** (Most Common) ‚ö†Ô∏è

Hubtel requires your server's IP address to be whitelisted!

**Solution:**
1. **Get Railway's IP Address:**
   - Railway uses dynamic IPs, but you can find current IP
   - Or contact Hubtel to whitelist Railway's IP range

2. **Contact Hubtel Support:**
   - Email: support@hubtel.com
   - Phone: +233 30 281 0808
   - Say: "Please whitelist my server IP for API access"
   - Provide: Your Client ID (GR69OD8)
   - They need: Railway's IP address

3. **Get Railway IP:**
   ```bash
   # Run this in Railway console or add to your app temporarily
   curl https://api.ipify.org
   ```

### 2. **API Credentials** 

**Check:**
- Client ID: `GR69OD8`
- Client Secret: `04abf4cbb3c041839c1c3af89c3ebea2`

**Verify:**
1. Login to Hubtel Dashboard: https://app.hubtel.com
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Confirm your credentials match

### 3. **Wrong API Endpoint**

**Current endpoint:**
```
https://api.hubtel.com/v1/merchantaccount/merchants/GR69OD8/receive/mobilemoney
```

**Alternative endpoints to try:**
```
https://api.hubtel.com/v2/merchantaccount/merchants/GR69OD8/receive/mobilemoney
```

OR

```
https://payproxyapi.hubtel.com/request-money/{phoneNumber}
```

### 4. **Account Not Activated**

Your Hubtel merchant account might not be fully activated for Direct Debit.

**Check:**
1. Login to Hubtel Dashboard
2. Check account status
3. Verify "Receive Money" is enabled

---

## üß™ Quick Test

### Test 1: Check if Route Exists

```bash
curl -X POST https://byupay.up.railway.app/api/student/initiate-hubtel-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber":"0241234567","amount":100,"paymentReference":"TEST","studentName":"Test","studentEmail":"test@example.com"}'
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ If you get JSON response (even with error) = Route exists
- ‚ùå If you get "Route not found" = Route doesn't exist (wait for deployment)

### Test 2: Check Railway Logs

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Find your backend project
3. Click "View Logs"
4. Look for:
   ```
   üöÄ Initiating Hubtel Direct Debit...
   ‚ùå Hubtel Direct Debit error: ...
   ```

The error message will tell you exactly what's wrong!

**Cause:** Wrong endpoint URL  
**Solution:**

2. Try alternative endpoints (v1 vs v2)

### Error: "Invalid merchant account"

**Cause:** Client ID doesn't match merchant account  
**Solution:**
1. Verify GR69OD8 is correct
2. Check Hubtel dashboard for correct merchant ID

### Error: "Service not enabled"

## üîß Alternative: Use Test Credentials

If you want to test immediately while waiting for IP whitelisting:

### Option 1: Hubtel Sandbox/Test Mode

Ask Hubtel if they have test credentials that don't require IP whitelisting.

### Option 2: Temporarily Use MTN Direct Only

While Hubtel is being set up, disable "Mobile Money (Hubtel)" and only use "MTN Mobile Money Direct" which doesn't need Hubtel API.

**To disable Hubtel option temporarily:**

```javascript
// frontend/src/components/HubtelPayment.jsx
const paymentMethods = [
  // Temporarily comment out Hubtel
  // { id: 'momo-hubtel', name: 'Mobile Money (Hubtel)', ... },
  { id: 'momo-direct', name: 'MTN Mobile Money Direct', ... }
];
```
