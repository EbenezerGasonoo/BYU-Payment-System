# 🎯 CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED - MIME Type Error Resolved

## 🐛 The Problem You Had

**Error in Browser Console:**
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script 
but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

### What Was Happening:

Your Vercel deployment was using the **old routing configuration** that was catching ALL requests - including JavaScript and CSS files - and returning the `index.html` file instead.

**Old vercel.json (BROKEN):**
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",          ❌ This catches EVERYTHING
      "dest": "/index.html"    ❌ Including your JS/CSS files!
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:**
- Browser requests: `/assets/index-bf6128f3.js`
- Vercel returns: `index.html` (with MIME type: text/html)
- Browser expects: JavaScript file (with MIME type: application/javascript)
- Browser shows: **MIME type error** ❌

---

## ✅ The Fix Applied

**New vercel.json (FIXED):**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [                    ✅ Uses rewrites instead of routes
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"  ✅ Only when file doesn't exist
    }
  ]
}
```

**How Rewrites Work:**
1. Browser requests `/assets/index-bf6128f3.js`
2. Vercel checks: "Does this file exist in dist/assets/?"
3. File exists → Serve the JS file with correct MIME type ✅
4. File doesn't exist → Serve index.html (for client-side routing) ✅
